ðŸ”„Ongoing Projects
======
- 2024-present: [IMIQ](https://www.niimo.ovgu.de/en/IMIQ.html) - Intelligent Mobility Space in the District.

  This project is aiming to change the Port of Science to a district of the future, where new solutions are conceived, technically tested, and socio-economically implemented in alignment with the citizens' needs.
  - Establishing a living lab for intelligent mobility
    - Research of innovative mobility concepts using an autonomous shuttle bus within a 5G test field
  - Establishing a Digital Work-Life Twin
    - Mapping of mobility and exploration of new possibilities, from simple depiction to the eventual integration of all real-time data
  - Funded by: [EFRE](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/de/sheet/95/europaischer-fonds-fur-regionale-entwicklung-efre-) - European Regional Development Fund
